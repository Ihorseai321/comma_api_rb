### Why I'm building this?

This is the prerequisite for a bigger project

My final target is to produce open source code so that someone can launch a Comma AI Comma points Eth/xDai Fauced DAO!!! :D

### The DAO will

- create a faucet/DAO
- accept funds
- redistribute funds every week folowing

time to build a poc? 1 week (4 weekends) - hopefully I can try to attempt this :D


### OK, back to reality (this repo)



### TODO

- JWT auth
- add more api methods (like to read some interesting data and graph it out?)
- add all the api methods
